# Face Recognition Project using Machine Learning

This project aims to implement face recognition using machine learning techniques, divided into different phases. It uses **OpenCV**, **DeepFace**, and other supporting libraries to capture and recognize faces.

## Modules Used
- **OpenCV (Haar Cascade)**: For face detection and capturing images.
- **DeepFace**: A deep learning framework for face recognition, built on top of TensorFlow and Keras.
- **OS**: Used for file management and directory operations.

## Requirements
- Python (latest version)
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- DeepFace (`pip install deepface`)
- TensorFlow (`pip install tensorflow`)
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)

## Project Phases

### Phase 1
- Captures user faces with user input for names.
- Saves the captured face in a local directory in JPG format.

### Phase 2
- Captures the userâ€™s face and waits for the user to enter a name.
- The user needs to press a specific key to trigger the face-saving process.

### Future Phases (Under Development)
- Additional phases will be added for more advanced face recognition features.
- Upcoming features may include real-time face recognition, enhanced accuracy, and other integrations.

## Potential Applications
- **Attendance Systems**: Automate attendance using facial recognition.
- **User Login Systems**: Implement secure login mechanisms with face ID verification.
- **Access Control**: Utilize face recognition to manage secure access to devices, rooms, or services.
